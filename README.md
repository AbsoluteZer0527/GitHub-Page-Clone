# Github-Repository-Page-Clone
learning tailwindcss through building a github repository page front-end (old version)

## Key Takeaways:

**1. Utility-First Styling with Tailwind CSS**

Learned to use Tailwind's utility classes to quickly design elements without custom CSS.
Experienced how Tailwind's responsive utilities make designing for different screen sizes easier.

**2. HTML Structure for Scalability**

Gained an understanding of structuring HTML efficiently for clarity and scalability. Since it is around 500+ lines of code, managing all the div elements in place is essential.

**3. Flexbox and Grid Layouts**

Mastered flexbox properties (flex-row, justify-between, etc.) to align elements precisely. Applied Tailwind’s grid system for consistent layout structure.

**5. Debugging Styling/Formatting**

Debugged issues such as overlapping or unaligned elements by examining Tailwind's class hierarchy. Improved Code Readability, and developed consistent class naming and grouping conventions for readability and maintainability.
