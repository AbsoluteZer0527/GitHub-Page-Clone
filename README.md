learning tailwindcss through building a github repository page front-end (old version)

## What I learned

**Utility-First Styling with Tailwind CSS**

Learned to use Tailwind's utility classes to quickly design elements without custom CSS.
Experienced how Tailwind's responsive utilities make designing for different screen sizes easier.

**HTML Structure for Scalability**

Gained an understanding of structuring HTML efficiently for clarity and scalability. Since it is around 500+ lines of code, managing all the div elements in place is essential.

**Flexbox and Grid Layouts**

Mastered flexbox properties (flex-row, justify-between, etc.) to align elements precisely. Applied Tailwindâ€™s grid system for consistent layout structure.

**Debugging Styling/Formatting**

Debugged issues such as overlapping or unaligned elements by examining Tailwind's class hierarchy. Improved Code Readability, and developed consistent class naming and grouping conventions for readability and maintainability.

This project was inspired by the GitHub homepage. It does not replicate all features but focuses on mimicking its UI layout using Tailwind CSS for learning purposes.
